-   `.premium-navigation__submenu-container` is applied to submenus to main menu items.
-   `.premium-navigation-item` is applied to every menu item.
-   `.premium-navigation-item__content` is applied to the link inside a menu item.
-   `.premium-navigation-item__label` is applied to the innermost container around the menu item text label.
